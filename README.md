Buddy Book is an interactive slambook website where users can create their own profile and invite friends to do the same. Each time a new team is created, an access ID is generated, which is required to join and view or add profiles within the team. The platform provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality on the Firebase database, allowing users to manage their profiles and teams efficiently. It creates a dynamic and personalized space for users to connect.

Each profile includes robust editing and deletion capabilities, empowering users to fully control their information.

With a **responsive design**, and an intuitive interface, Buddy Book offers a smooth and interactive social networking experience.
